Site-Configuration

This is an experimental package to help Grid sites configure their systems more
easily. It currently reads configuration files in INI format and makes the data
therein available through tied hashes. The only extra functionality right now
is easy access to VO specific parameters.

This is still in the experimental stages and interfaces may change often and
without notification and/or backward compatibility. Be warned!
